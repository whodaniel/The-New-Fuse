## Critical Issues Identified

### 🚨 Priority 1: Missing Routes for New Pages

The following pages exist in the codebase but are **NOT** included in the
router:

1. **Pricing** (`/pricing`) - `apps/frontend/src/pages/Pricing.tsx`
2. **Docs** (`/docs`) - `apps/frontend/src/pages/Docs.tsx`
3. **Support** (`/support`) - `apps/frontend/src/pages/Support.tsx`
4. **Integrations** (`/integrations`) -
   `apps/frontend/src/pages/Integrations.tsx`
5. **Features** (`/features`) - `apps/frontend/src/pages/Features.tsx`
6. **Blog** (`/blog`) - `apps/frontend/src/pages/Blog.tsx`

**Impact**: These pages are inaccessible to users despite being fully built.

**Recommendation**: Add these routes to `/apps/frontend/src/routes/index.tsx` as
public routes.

### ⚠️ Priority 2: Duplicate/Inconsistent Pages

Several pages have multiple implementations:

- Landing page has 3 versions: `Landing.tsx`, `LandingPage.tsx`,
  `LandingRedesigned.tsx`
- Multiple login/register entry points

**Recommendation**: Consolidate to single canonical version.

### ⚠️ Priority 3: Unused Pages

Many pages listed in `AllPages.tsx` are not routed:

- `/all-pages` itself is not routed
- Debug pages
- Alternative implementations

**Recommendation**: Either route these pages or remove from inventory.
