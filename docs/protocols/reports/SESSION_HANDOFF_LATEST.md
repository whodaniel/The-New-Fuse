- [GUARDRAIL-COMPLIANT] Do not merge PR 264 until operator signoff after a green
  official root turbo build on a machine with >=8Gi free. (acknowledged; no
  merge performed; disk cleared to 8Gi; build is GREEN)
- [GUARDRAIL-COMPLIANT] Keep PR 253 separate on recon/S1. Do not retarget or
  conflate. (branch recon/s1-cron-provision-reproducibility intact, untouched)
- [GUARDRAIL-COMPLETED] Re-run official pnpm run build (cold .turbo) then root
  type-check/test if required by launch-train, once disk headroom exists. (DONE:
  disk cleared to 8Gi, cold turbo build GREEN, type-check GREEN, root tests
  GREEN after agent-coordination fix)
- [GUARDRAIL-COMPLIANT] Preserve .tnf-recovery/tnf-rc-gate-scripts (probe files
  from removed tnf-rc-gate worktree). Do not commit
  apps/frontend/src/data/codebase_map.json. (DONE)
- ⚠️ NEEDS LIVE OPERATOR CONFIRMATION (do not auto-commit): 38 file(s)
